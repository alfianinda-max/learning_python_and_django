### variable 

# age = 17
# name = "Inna"

# print(age)
# print("Hello my name is {}. I am {} years old from Mars".format(name, age))

### exercise 1

# Set that equal to the variable called sentence

# name = "Julie"
# age = 42
# sentence = "Hi my name is {} and I am {} years old".format(name, age)
# print(sentence)
